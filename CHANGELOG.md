## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Drop the `codec_map.rs` parallel codec table**; demuxer + muxer
  now resolve codec identity via `oxideav_core::CodecResolver`.
  Each codec crate is the source of truth for its own AVI FourCCs /
  WAVE format tags via `CodecInfo::tag(s)`. Replaces a 300-LOC
  hand-maintained table with the shared registry surface and
  removes a class of "container forgot to update its codec_map"
  bugs entirely.
- **Switch wire-tag resolution to `CodecParameters::tag`**.
  - **Demuxer**: stamps `params.tag = Some(CodecTag::fourcc(...))`
    (video, from `bmih.bi_compression`) /
    `Some(CodecTag::wave_format(...))` (audio, from `wfx.format_tag`)
    so a muxer re-emitting the stream round-trips the demuxed
    FourCC / wFormatTag byte-for-byte. Forward
    `CodecResolver::resolve_tag` direction is unchanged.
  - **Muxer**: new resolution priority — (1) `params.tag` if set,
    (2) printable `extradata[0..4]` as a legacy fallback,
    (3) `[0,0,0,0]` BI_RGB sentinel for `rgb24` (video) / PCM-family
    synthesis from codec_id (audio). The previous
    `CodecResolver::tag_for_codec` path is gone (removed in
    `oxideav-core` 0.1.26 — registering a codec_id's "first
    declared FourCC" was arbitrary on multi-tag codecs and broke
    round-trip). Multi-FourCC codecs (`mpeg4video` /
    `magicyuv`'s 17 native v7 variants) get the right FourCC by
    setting `params.tag` on the encoder side or letting the demuxer
    propagate it from the source file.
- **API surface**: dropped `muxer::open_with_codecs` and
  `muxer::open_with_codecs_and_kind` — the muxer no longer needs an
  `&dyn CodecResolver`. Use `muxer::open` / `muxer::open_with_kind`
  with `params.tag` set on each stream.

### Added

- OpenDML 2.0 super-index encode in the muxer. New `AviKind` enum
  (`Avi10` / `OpenDml(RiffSegmentLimit)`) and `RiffSegmentLimit` enum
  (`OneGiB` / `Bytes(u64)`) opt the muxer into multi-`RIFF AVIX`
  emission with an `indx` super-index in the first stream's `strl`.
  Per-stream `ix##` chunks are intentionally omitted (spec/06 §6.1
  carve-out: the codec consumes the sequence of packets one at a
  time; ix## is informational). Use `muxer::open_with_kind` to opt
  in; `muxer::open` continues to emit AVI 1.0 single-RIFF.
- Demuxer now parses `indx` super-index chunks under `strl` for
  validation (24-byte preamble + nEntriesInUse × 16 B). The existing
  `RIFF AVIX` continuation walker (which handles multi-segment
  decoding) was already in place; this round just adds the
  super-index awareness inside `strl`.
- MagicYUV native FourCC family (17 entries, spec/01 §4.1):
  `M8RG`/`M8RA`/`M8Y4`/`M8Y2`/`M8Y0`/`M8YA`/`M8G0` (8-bit),
  `M0RG`/`M0RA`/`M0Y4`/`M0Y2`/`M0Y0`/`M0G0` (10-bit),
  `M2RG`/`M2RA` (12-bit), `M4RG`/`M4RA` (14-bit) all map to codec_id
  `"magicyuv"`. Muxer side: codec_id `"magicyuv"` + an optional
  4-byte FourCC hint at the start of `extradata` picks the wire
  FourCC (default `M8RG`).

### Notes

- OpenDML-driven seeking from the `indx` super-index is a follow-up:
  the demuxer parses `indx` for visibility but `seek_to` still
  consults only the AVI 1.0 `idx1` table. AVI files without `idx1`
  (streamed / OpenDML-only) return `Error::Unsupported` for seek;
  linear decode still walks every `RIFF AVIX` continuation.
